LIFE INSURANCELIFE INSURANCEPOLICY BOOKLETINTRODUCTION Words that appear in bold are explained in the section headed ‘Definitions’. This Policy Booklet shows you the features, benefits and exclusions (things that are not covered) that apply to this product. WHO IS COVERED?The life insured is covered.PREMIUMS Premiums can be paid either monthly or annually and start on the policy start date.Guaranteed premiums Your premiums are guaranteed and will not change unless you make changes to the policy using the options available in the section headed ‘Changing your policy’.  Increasing cover Yo u may have the option to choose an increasing policy, the premiums will increase in line with the changes in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) multiplied by 1.5 subject to a maximum increase of 15% per annum.  The RPI provides an indication of inflation on a monthly basis. The RPI measures and tracks the average change in the purchase price of goods and services such as housing expenses and mortgage interest payments. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PREMIUMS ARE NOT PAID? We are entitled to cancel the policy if any premiums are not paid within 60 days of their due date. If we cancel the policy, your cover will end and no further premiums will be payable. We will not refund any premiums already paid. WHAT HAPPENS TO AN ANNUAL PREMIUM IF A CLAIM IS PAID? If the premium is paid annually and a claim is paid, we will pay a pro-rata refund of the premium for the remaining months of that year. The policy will end when a claim is paid and no further premiums will be payable.LIFE INSURANCE2AMOUNT OF COVER Level cover If you choose level cover the amount of cover will stay the same unless you change it using the options available in the section headed 'Changing your policy' during the period of cover. Decreasing cover If you choose decreasing cover the amount of cover will reduce during the period of cover. Decreasing cover is often used to help protect a repayment mortgage. We apply an interest rate to the original amount of cover to estimate the amount that you repay each month on your repayment mortgage and the amount you are covered for will decrease accordingly. If the interest rate we apply is less than the interest rate that is actually applied to your mortgage, or your  mortgage changes, the amount we pay out may not be enough to repay your mortgage in full.  The interest rate applied will be shown in your Policy Booklet. To ensure that the amount paid out will cover the amount of your outstanding mortgage you should check regularly that the interest rate applied to the policy is equal to or higher than the interest rate applied to your mortgage by your lender. Increasing cover Yo u may have the option to choose increasing cover, the amount of cover will increase in line with changes in inflation on each policy anniversary with no need to answer further questions about your health. The amount of cover, including any increases you have already accepted, will increase in line with the changes in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) over a 12 month period. If we cannot use the RPI, we will use an index comparable to the RPI instead. We will contact you at least three months before the policy anniversary to tell you what the increase in the amount of cover and premium will be. If the change in the RPI is less than 1% we will not increase the amount of cover. If the change in the RPI is more than 10% we will only increase the amount of cover by 10% per annum. Your options Accept the increase: If you choose to accept the increase you do not need to take any action. We will increase the amount of cover and the premium and update your direct debit. Decline the increase: When we notify you of an increase, we will also give you the option to decline the increase. To decline an increase, you must complete and return the form in the letter we send to you by the date shown. If you choose to decline the increase to the amount of cover and premium, then we will withdraw the option and you will not be given the option to increase the amount of cover in the future.
