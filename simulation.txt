You: As a retiree, I am concerned about the increasing medical expenses and the financial burden it may impose on my family. Can you please guide me about the best health insurance policy that would cover my medical expenses, including hospitalization, medication, and regular check-ups? Also, I would like to know if there are any policies that provide benefits to my spouse after my demise.
